This repository shows my in-progress work to solve the Course Project corresponding to the Coursera course:


**Getting and Cleaning Data**


Full project should containg:

* README.md file

* CodeBook.md file

* run_analysis.R

The script named run_analysis.R has to perform:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


It took me a lot of time my desire to read all the files, including the ones into the *Inertial Signals* directory (my computer had not memory enough to work with all  of them)


At the end I decided to work only with x and y data sets. Too late, I am afraid!!!
